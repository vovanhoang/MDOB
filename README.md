Perform an approach that applies feature set optimization method and ensemble learning model for the malware detection.

For the Manuscript "MDOB: Enhancing Resilient and Explainable AI-Powered Malware Detection Using Feature Set Optimization and Mutual Deep+Boosting Ensemble Inference"!

In order to validate and evaluate the effectiveness of the MDOB method, we use EMBER 2017 and EMBER 2018 datasets.

1. The first dataset (DS1) includes EMBER 2017 & 2018 original dataset. The goal of using this dataset is to verify MFODB's ability to detect malware attacks by analyzing the PE file correctly.

2. The second dataset (DS2):  use the EMBER 2018 as benchmark dataset to test our model. Given that this dataset is considered more challenging than its previous iteration. Thus, our goal when using this data set is to objectively compare the efficiency of the MFODB method with other studies using the same dataset.

From the dataset, we constitute a dataset for testing. The dataset contains two parts: training and testing (600k train, 200k test).
