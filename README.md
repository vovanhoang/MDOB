# REMDABEL: Resilient and Explainable AI-Powered Malware Detection Using Dataset Augmentation and Boosting-Based Ensemble Learning


Perform an approach that combines a rule-based and ensemble learning model for the intrusion detection system.

For the Manuscript "REMDABEL: Resilient and Explainable AI-Powered Malware Detection Using Dataset Augmentation and Boosting-Based Ensemble Learning"!

In order to validate and evaluate the effectiveness of the REMDABEL method, we use EMBER 2018 dataset.

1. The first dataset (DS1) includes EMBER 2017 & 2018 original dataset. The goal of using this dataset is to verify REMDABEL's ability to detect malware attacks by analyzing the PE file correctly.

2. The second dataset (DS2):  use the EMBER 2018 as benchmark dataset to test our model. Given that this dataset is considered more challenging than its previous iteration. Thus, our goal when using this data set is to objectively compare the efficiency of the REMDABEL method with other studies using the same dataset.

From the dataset, we constitute a dataset for testing. The dataset contains two parts: training and testing (600k train, 200k test).
